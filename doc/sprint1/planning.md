# 2. Technical decisions and coordination #

- Each floor has access points, each with a 25m range (radius). The APs are placed in
  strategic locations to avoid overlap between floors and are connected to a ceiling outlet.
  Also, different channels will be used to avoid interference.
- The distance between two network outlets is less than 3 meters to improve accessibility.
- Cross-connects are located in the recommended rooms in the project description.
- Cable pathways were designed to minimize cable length, optimizing network performance and reducing material costs.
- A cable raceway was installed in the dropped ceiling on Floor 1, as recommended in the project description, ensuring a clean and organized cabling infrastructure.
- Multimode Fiber is used for high-speed network connections between Intermediate Cross-connects (IC) and Horizontal Cross-connects (HC).
- CAT7 Copper Cables are used for connections between Horizontal Cross-connects (HC) and Network Outlets (RJ45).
