## BUILDING 3 INFORMATION
- Both floors of this building have, approximately, 30 x 30 meters of horizontal dimension.
- Both floors of this building require full wireless LAN coverage (Wi-Fi).

### GROUND FLOOR ###

- The ground floor has an underfloor cable raceway connected to the external technical ditch. Access to
  the underfloor cable raceway is available at points marked over the plan. The ceiling height on this floor
  is four meters.
- Room 3.0.14 is a storage area that may be used to house a cross-connect, no network outlets are required there.
- Rooms 3.0.1, 3.0.2, and 3.0.3 have specific purposes and the only network outlets required there are two near each floor cable passageway. Elsewhere, the
  standard number of network outlets per area ratio is to be enforced.

### FIRST FLOOR ###

- The ceiling height on this floor is three meters, but there is a removable dropped ceiling, placed 2.5
  meters from the ground, covering this entire floor. The empty space over the dropped ceiling is perfect
  to install cable raceways and wireless access-points.
- Room 3.1.1 is a wireless only area, no network outlets are required, but on the other hand the wireless
  LAN coverage (Wi-Fi) should be highly effective here
- Room 3.1.8 is a storage area, no network outlets are required there as well, and it may be used to house
  a cross-connect and other network infrastructure hardware.

### OUTLETS ###
For the calculations regarding the number of network outlets for each room, it was based on
the Structured Cabling Standard. According to this standard, each work area must have at least two outlets, and it also recommends two outlets for every 10 square meters of space.

For example:
- A room between 10 m² and 20 m² should have 4 outlets.
- A room between 20 m² and 30 m² should have 6 outlets.

The room measurements were taken using https://eleif.net/photomeasure.

## BUILDING 3 CABLE SYSTEM

- Each floor has access points with a 25m range (radius). The APs are placed in
  strategic locations to avoid overlap between floors and are connected to a ceiling outlet.
  Also, different channels will be used to avoid interference.
- The distance between two network outlets is less than 3 meters to improve accessibility.
- As recommended in the project description, cross-connects are located in the storage area.
- Cable pathways were designed to minimize cable length, optimizing network performance and reducing material costs.
- A cable raceway was installed in the dropped ceiling on Floor 1, as recommended in the project description, ensuring a clean and organized cabling infrastructure.
